In this part of this exercise, I will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. 

The first figure shows the scatter plot of profit and population in the city.

In this part, I will fit the linear regression parameters Î¸ to our dataset using gradient descent. 
```
x^y
```
For population = 35,000, we predict a profit of 4519.767868
For population = 70,000, we predict a profit of 45342.450129
